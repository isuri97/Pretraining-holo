Protestants p.4 . Catholics p.7 . Illegal Life in Holland I moved to Holland back in 1928 having applied for a job p.5 there and been given the position . I only witnessed the events leading up to the occupation of Holland in 1940 from the outside . My mother and stepfather were living in Germany and I went to visit them often . However I had any first hand experience of National Socialism before 1940 . I lived in Amsterdam and worked as a grain merchant having completed a business apprenticeship before moving to Holland . I then got some practical experience at a grain mill at the port in Rotterdam where I came into contact with common working class folk . This was how I learnt Dutch and I picked up how to speak the language as the locals did . This was very important later on in terms of disguising myself to fit in . Later I went on to work at the company\ headquarters . When the Germans invaded Holland on 11 May 1940 I knew exactly what this would mean for me as a Jew . To start with I carried on with my employment as a mid level employee at a large trading company . I did not have Dutch citizenship . The Nazi\ first approach was to force the Jews to deliver radios and bicycles but I affected by this in the beginning . After the Germans marched into Amsterdam a suicide epidemic erupted . Two of my friends were among those involved in this but one was stopped before it was too late . Others tried to flee illegally . Basically us Jews were under no illusions about the fate that awaited us . At this time I was a member of the KP Neederlande . It was extremely difficult when in February 1941 the so called Dutch National Socialist Movement – presumably on the Germans\ orders – started a small scale pogrom in Amsterdam abusing older people and the like . Us Jews in Amsterdam had our own structure that reflected that in place amongst the population at large . So we had Jewish police officers Jewish craftsmen Jewish scientists and Jewish bank directors . The psychological effects of this were as follows When the Nazis smashed up Bank Director Cohn china in Frankfurt his response may well have been Oh well as long as that all that happens . But Postman Cohn or Unemployed Cohn in Amsterdam was not quite so calm following the destruction of his bed given that items had been taken away from him that were essential to his life . The outward difference here was that the neighbour of Mr Bank Director Cohn in Frankfurt would either have been a man in a similar position to our Mr Cohn with a similar way of thinking or perhaps it would have been Postman Müller who would have told himself that Mr Bank Director got what he deserved . The neighbour of Postman Cohn in Amsterdam on the other hand would have been Locksmith Jansen and he would have known only too well what it meant 2 to be robbed of things vital to you . His reaction would therefore have been to show solidarity . The result of all this was that a large number of Jewish craftsmen and workers stayed with their families in the days that followed the pogrom and defended their property when there was a second attempt at a riot of this kind . They fought back against the members of the Dutch National Socialist Movement beating them out of the Jewish quarter which had existed since the Middle Ages and where of the working class Jewish population had continued to live . As they retreated the Dutch Nazis were then attacked and beaten by non Jewish workers . The German occupying forces who were yet to make an appearance in this particular situation responded by detaining and deporting Jews predominantly young men to Mauthausen concentration camp . Just a few short days after these young people were taken away their families received the news that they had all died from heart problems . Only one of them who had escaped in transit and returned to Amsterdam was reported to have been shot while trying to escape . The population of Amsterdam was severely emotionally affected and responded with anger . A general strike was declared and the KP Neederlande thought to have instigated it . All business in Amsterdam was brought to a complete halt for around 24 hours . No trams or other public transport was running and workers walked out of their factories salespeople left their stores and office workers abandoned their offices . I personally been told about the planned strike beforehand but I joined in as soon as I heard about it by leaving work in such a way that made the others follow me . If you ask me there were a lot of victims from this one day strike since the Nazis just sit back and accept it . In fact taking this stand was a really important move as far as the resistance against the Germans was concerned because it showed the Dutch population that resistance was a viable option . Plus the fact that people have to be affiliated to a particular political party in order to join in with the strike meant that even people based outside of Amsterdam who even actively involved in it then felt morally obliged to take part in some form of resistance against the German occupying forces . The repressive measures now being enforced by the Germans only encouraged this reaction . They were initially only aimed at the Jews who were oppressed further shortly after this time . As business had come to a complete standstill particularly within my line of work I took a course on autogenous welding and also went to a specialist school for metal workers . This gave me a way to get closer to the working population of the city . Although I had absolutely no clue about the ins and outs I was gradually becoming convinced that all of us Jews were going to either be murdered or end up dying in a concentration camp somewhere anyway if the war 3 end with the Germans being defeated soon . As the developments at the front made it look unlikely that the war would be coming to an end in the foreseeable future I made the decision to die standing . I had joined the KP Neederlande just after the Nazis came to power in Germany . Up to this point my involvement in the party extended beyond taking part in Marxist training courses and getting involved in providing aid to Jewish and non Jewish emigrants . It was showing anti Fascist solidarity without a party specific . One evening we were in a class being taught about the Communist manifesto by a German Communist when there was a knock at the door . One of our comrades came in and took the course instructor out of the room . The latter came back in shortly and announced going to Spain . He turned to me and said You can take over with the rest of the teaching . My immediate response was that I had enough training myself . He replied If I can decide to go to Spain in less than 10 minutes you can prepare yourself to teach the rest of the course in that time too . Of course that was long before the Second World War broke out . Shortly after the strike I mentioned before one KP member came to me to ask if I would be willing to join in with the illegal fight against the Nazis . I agreed to be part of the fight and was tasked with putting together a group that I would first have to teach about the views on the need for a resistance movement and what form this should take . However I was only given very little in the way of instructions from the top so that I would be able to stick to my task of bringing people up to speed on the ideology . I have to say that this bringing people up to speed was definitely influenced significantly by my own Marxist beliefs which did not necessarily strictly follow the teachings of the party . I was very much of the belief that anything that would strengthen the resistance was good and anyone willing to respond to the call to arms was welcome regardless of their motivation . And it was by following these principles that I succeeded . I was then entrusted with designing and printing flyers . In the meantime the situation had progressed to the point that it was suggested that the Jewish employees at my company around 12 to 15 people should leave I was actually only still part of the company nominally as there was still the option of a settlement being paid out at this stage but there was some speculation about them maybe having to let us go in a few weeks without this payment . At this point unemployed people in Holland were forced to go to Germany as foreign labourers so the majority of Dutch companies held on to their staff even when there enough work for them . This was the case at the company I worked for . We the Jewish contingent at work decided to accept the management offer 4 to take six months pay but leave immediately . And I want to add at this point that I and others received financial support from the Directors later down the line . It was around this time that the Jewish star badges were introduced in Holland and I wore one myself for a few weeks . After being mobbed and threatened by German soldiers and officers though I decided to resolve this issue by no longer wearing the Jewish star . 1941 was drawing to a close when I heard that the Gestapo and Green Police were starting to arrest Jews with German citizenship . A concentration camp had already been set up for these Jews in Westerbork . According to my reliable sources there actually any particular atrocities to report of there – at least back then – because everyone was sent on elsewhere from there . I decided that I needed to disappear and from that moment on I was living illegally . This marked the start of a new phase in my life . At the time I knew an old woman – she was a non Jewish German – who was doing very badly indeed . I had been paying the rent on her small apartment for a long time having been prompted to help out by some Dutch friends . I offered to kit this woman\ home out with my furniture and she accepted . Then when they started to search Jews\ homes and make arrests there I made my way to her place to hide out . Just a few days later the German police did actually show up at my cleared out apartment . Obviously when I started out in my new illegal life I lost the option of collecting ration cards in the usual way . To start off with I turned to the owner of a small grocery store who I knew was a devout Protestant . Once we had pushed past some conflicting morals he agreed to feed me from his stocks . He continued to do this for some time . I was living in a working class district along with a Jewish minority . Young Jews in particular were arrested there at every opportunity and my landlady started to get nervous . I was worried that she might be so scared that she would betray me O a long time having been prompted to help out by some Dutch friends a long time having been prompted to help out by some Dutch friends Hague . I had some friends a Protestant man and Jewish woman there who offered me a place to hide . I know my way around the city at all and one day I ended up right in the middle of a Jewish raid . Back in Amsterdam I had managed to get hold of forged ID papers . The forgery exactly the most sophisticated and I was terrified that there was no way that the Dutch police officer who had caught me notice . I decided to take a risk and rudely told him that I would have to lodge a complaint if he let me go on my way immediately . I explained that I was in The Hague on official business for the Ministry of Food . I went on to say that I had absolutely no idea what he wanted with me and that they had detained me for several hours in Amsterdam too without any legitimate reason . The police officer started to bluff and apologised explaining that I looked a bit Jewish and that the stamp on my ID papers had made him suspicious note that this was the only genuine thing on the documentation . Then he let me go . I asked my friend in The Hague to travel to Amsterdam for me to find out how my 5 female Jewish was doing . He came back with the news that she and her brother had been summoned to work in Poland and that they would be leaving the next morning . I made my way to Amsterdam without delay and went to the apartment that my friend whose father did some minor tailoring work lived in . When I entered the apartment my friend was sitting at the table with her mother and two strange men . My friend jumped up and politely asked me as though I were a stranger What do you want ? I understood what she was doing and answered Your father has had one of my suits for six weeks now . I want it back as I need to wear it . I will come back at 7 this evening and I will be taking it away with me . I care whether it is repaired or not . And I stormed out of the apartment swearing under my breath . I waited over the road – in the shop of the greengrocer I mentioned earlier – until the two officials had left . I then went back into the apartment took my friend\ hand in mine and together we left the apartment in which her parents and brothers lived . She never saw them again . Her younger brother was deported the very next day and her parents were too a few weeks later . We stayed in The Hague with the same friends as before for a while . It long before the KP sourced us some ration cards . These cards had been stolen from rural offices by action groups which were not linked to any particular political party and also included a lot of students . One student group managed to get hold of better ID papers for me and my female friend . I also asked students to get similar papers for other Jews in hiding . We had to pay a price for these papers . One of the Directors at the company I used to work at gave me the money we needed without making me tell him what I was going to use it for . In Holland this was a matter of pride and honour . A national front had been created – an individual\ political leanings matter anymore . It was all about doing whatever it took to save people\ lives . After a few weeks I thought it was advisable that my female friend and I moved in with some acquaintances of my male friend . I then left her there alone and returned to Amsterdam where I stayed with someone I used to work with who was now working as a minor official at a government office . He stole some sheets of paper with an official letterhead and a genuine government stamp for me . I used them to create official assignments that I could use for identification purposes . For example I used the following kind of text addressed to myself Upon your visit to company X or Y it is essential that you check they are using this or that type of flour . I was careful to never use any names in these letters . Now that I was back in Amsterdam I took charge of my old group again and we started to copy and disseminate anti Nazi propaganda materials like before . For instance we equipped the basement of one house with typewriters and 6 copiers . When we arrived to start work one morning we noticed there had been a break in and the typewriters had been stolen . We moved our base to another location right away . However the KP informed reliable people in the surrounding area that the machines that had been stolen were being used as a weapon against the Germans . A few nights later they had been returned to us . I carried on with this work with the group for months and months until a few days before the Easter of 1943 when we found out that a man had been arrested with one of our flyers on him . He had been given the flyer directly by one of my workers who was a 22 year old newlywed Dutchman . I broke the group up immediately and told the Dutchman to go into hiding right away . Unfortunately he want to leave his young wife on her own and a few days later he was arrested . About a week after that his wife received the news that he had died from a heart condition . Given that no searches were performed at my home or at the home of any of the other members of our group around this time we can assume that this young Dutch man\ unbreakable silence was the cause of his death . To be on the safe side I moved several times outside of Amsterdam . Upon my return to the city I found that my friends were ready to continue with our work without any exceptions . I got a gun at this point and once again resolved to never be taken in by the Germans alive . The situation continued to get more and more critical . It goes without saying that the Germans were not unaware of the fact that many Jews were in hiding in Holland . They ramped up the raids . One of my Jewish friends was found in his hideout . He tried to resist and was killed there and then . It was also around this time that the friends I had stayed within The Hague were arrested . My friend\ Jewish wife had taken her mother and brother in . These two were detained and sent to Poland whilst the wife herself was taken to a camp before being exonerated there and deported . Her husband also ended up in a concentration camp . He actually survived and the child is still alive now too . I then found out that there was a Dutch man living in who had a way of smuggling Jews out of the country . I believed him to be an informant and tried to ascertain whether or not my suspicions were justified by visiting him at his home . The man was very taken aback by my visit but said he would be willing to get me to Switzerland . When I asked him for details about the transport and preparations it became clear that he was in fact a Gestapo agent . I regret not shooting him there and then . He was later sentenced to life in prison . At least I was then able to warn my friends against him . As time went by I had to keep moving but the groups\ actions continued . These actions could be divided into two categories 1 . Those that had a direct benefit i.e. using force 7 to source food for the huge number of people living illegally Jews people being persecuted for their political views and people who had gone into hiding so they sent abroad as foreign labourers . 2 . At a later stage acts of sabotage that were aimed at disrupting the tools and equipment of the German armed forces mainly transport and communication links . Alongside these activities we also pursued our propaganda based work throughout the entire occupation . The aim of this was to keep the spirit of resistance alive among the people . Some of the things we did were objectively unproductive but they were still a statement of that desire to resist . Examples included an arson attack on a German cinema and robbing a Dutch office when ration cards were being given out . When I was living illegally I bumped into a former colleague who was an Oberleutnant Fist Lieutenant in the Dutch Army . He waste any time before asking me Are you living illegally ? When I answered yes he asked where I would be eating that evening . Realising that my food situation all that great he said coming for dinner at mine . I had mixed feelings about going but I was very well fed . During that evening the officer said to me I know any Jews and I want to because I like them . But I get involved with that Nazi scum because of it . This man was an antisemite in every sense of the word . But he had invited me over at a critical time to prove to himself that his hate of the Jews had nothing whatsoever to do with the antisemitism of the Nazis . One day the Germans searched systematically for Jews throughout the southern district of Amsterdam . By chance I managed to avoid this raid despite living in the area . At the time I was in contact with a German woman who worked in the SD Security Service kitchen and invited me along so I could eat . The SD aware that this woman\ fiancé had been killed by the SA Assault Division several years previously for political reasons . When I went to see her one Saturday lunchtime to get something to eat she told me that I needed to leave the city right away as a squad of thousands of police officers was expected to arrive later that day . I ran out of the house grabbing a fishing rod that was standing in the hallway and retreated to the countryside . I returned to Amsterdam around two days later and although I been caught several hundred Jews had been arrested . What I can say is that there were two groups of trustworthy helpers standing by at all times political and religious fanatics . As I avoided people that I knew to be Communists to protect my safety I often had to turn to devout Christians when it came to finding somewhere to stay . A former colleague from the company I worked at before – a dedicated Catholic and father to seven children 8 living in a cramped apartment – said he would be willing to take me in any time . He also shared the little food he and his kids had with me on several occasions . I was really touched when once as we were saying goodnight the youngest in the family who was only about four years old promised me that he and his siblings prayed for me every night . I still had to move on a regular basis especially once I discovered after a while that the SD were interested in finding out where I was staying and that they even knew a few of my cover names . I never did find out where they got that information from . Eventually I ended up back in The Hague . This was around the time the Battle of Arnheim broke out in 1944 . After my female friend had been working as a maid in a residential suburb just outside of The Hague for a while I had let her leave for Arnheim where she had been promised somewhere safe to stay . But now I considered her life to be in danger there so I sourced a Red Cross vehicle with two uniformed drivers . These drivers would however require a command to travel and the only way to get one of those was with a genuine medical certificate . I went to a random doctor and asked for one of these certificates for my female friend so I could go and get her . I failed to mention anything about the nature of her illness to him though . When the nonplussed doctor asked to see some form of identification I simply showed him my gun . That seemed to do the trick . I sent one of the drivers off with the medical certificate to the office that needed to issue the travel command . I decided to stay with the doctor whilst the driver did this as I risk the terrified man being so scared that he felt the need to call this office to declare the certificate invalid . Luckily everything worked out well and we drove straight from the doctor\ house to Arnheim . On the way there we come across a single vehicle but the roads were littered with burnt out cars . German and English artillery shots were fired above us throughout our entire journey . We saw German troops lying in the ditches to the sides of the roads but we managed to make it to Arnheim without any trouble at all . The house that my female friend had been living in had been abandoned . The house next door was completely destroyed . After wandering around for a while we eventually found who we were looking for and we were able to set off together on our journey back to The Hague . On the way this time an SS staff messenger stopped us and got into our car . Despite our protests and attempts to quote the Geneva Convention he go away . However in the end having him with us may have provided us with some protection against any further checks . Shortly after this I was stopped in the street in Amsterdam by an SS officer during one operation . He pulled me into the hallway of a house and started to question me there . I was frightened to death because I had illegal materials with me in my briefcase although they were well hidden away in amongst dirty laundry . The man exactly the sharpest tool in the box luckily . 9 I was able to deceive him by pretending to be really stupid . I started off being very friendly and giving him information about myself and my situation but when he asked me any further questions I just played dumb and acted ignorant . After a lot of going back and forth he eventually let me go . Some of the stories might sound like they are so simple now but everything we did was accompanied by an overwhelming sense of fear . In the summer of 1944 I heard that the Gestapo had searched several of my former homes and were also trying to find out information about me . At this time the worsening food shortage also meant that all of the people that had helped me by giving me a roof over my head started to lose their nerve and I once again found myself struggling to find accommodation even for one night at a time . Based on all of these factors I decided to make the leap over to the allied armies . The Dutch brother of my landlady at the time was afraid of being taken in as a foreign labourer and so he decided to join me in my plan to head to the south of the country or to Belgium until we found allied troops . I found a ladies\ bike without any tyres and took it with me on my journey . The hardest part was having to cross the three big branches of the Rhine with some of the crossings under heavy surveillance or completely destroyed . But we managed it and we arrived in Tilburg the city in which my companion\ childhood home was located sometime around 24 August 1944 . The English army occupied Tilburg just two or three days later and my time living illegally came to an end . I later heard that my final fixed abode had been searched and all of my housemates had been arrested . Luckily they had all survived .

1	After setting fire to the synagogue and destroying Jewish property in Breslau the Gestapo rounded up the whole male Jewish population . Rosten was arrested on 11 November 1938 and sent to Buchenwald . About people arrived there within two days . 5 storeys of shelves of bare wood served as sleeping accommodation . People were flogged at night in front of the huts and many perished . P. Rosten Experiences in Buchenwald Concentration Camp In the following pages I shall describe in the whole only my personal experiences what I have seen with my eyes or have heard with my ears . Should I mention events I have been told by other people I would make it quite clear . In the night of November 9th to 10th 1938 the night following the mysterious death of one of the German Secretaries to the German Embassy in Paris shot at by a young Jew at Breslau the town where I lived like in all the other towns in the whole of Germany the biggest Jewish Synagogue a large building in the middle of the town was set on fire by the SS and all Jewish shops were destroyed . In the morning I got the news by phone from my sister and went to see with my own eyes what I could believe . It was really true the large building situated next to the Police H.Q. was ablaze and walking home I saw the shattered windos in Jewish shops . I met many of the Gestapo lorries giving the special hooting signal of the Gestapo loaded with Jews who were brought to the Police H.Q. I went home to carry on with my practice . Very soon friends of ours whose husbands had been arrested by the SS called on us telling how it happened and asking advice . The whole day long I got news that acquaintances of ours had been taken to the Police even a boy of 16 . Jews walking in the streets were arrested it was clear that the Gestapo was rounding up the whole male Jewish population it was a real pogrom . From 11 in the morning my phone did not work and I was awaiting the SS during the whole day . But not before 6 next morning 3 SS men came fetch me and to bring me to the next Police Station . I was the first man arrested in our district on this day November 11th . About 6 men in plain clothes were sitting in one room there with long lists apparently checking the list of the Jews in that district who had to be arrested . Every few minutes one or more newcomers arrived all Jews or of Jewish origin very many of them of course acquaintances of mine . of us knew what happened to the men arrested the day before . I was rather sure that they were kept still at Police H.Q. In the middle of the morning we were brought by a lorry there where we had to remain the whole day in a courtyard standing without any possibility of sitting down . Till the late afternoon more Jews arrived . From time to time we 2 had to move round in the rather small courtyard to keep warm as it was rather cold . Between 4 and 5 we got a rather thin rice soup Please note this time ! . In the evening we were moved into a larger courtyard and from there guarded by SS men and mounted police to a Railway Station where a special train was waiting for us . The compartments were not crowded . In every compartment were posted a Police Officer fully armed with pistol and rifle and an armed SS man . Besides a kick with the butt end of a rifle if somebody was not quick enough in boarding the train nothing happened . I reckon that we were about 1000 to 1500 arrested people . The train left Breslau at about 10 in the night and arrived at Weimar next morning at about 8 . Long before watching the stations where thr train stopped we had no doubt about our journay destination After the train had stopped in Weimar Station Police Officers with loaded rifles were placed at both sides of the train filled with unarmed Jews their rifles directed against the windows of the train . During the time we had to wait for the order to leave the train we had ample opportunity to get to know the mentatlity of our future guards . A youngster belonging to the SS Death Head Formation came into our compartment telling that he lived formerly at Breslau too and asking for some Jewish people he would have liked to meet in the C.C. He was not more than 20 . The whole lot guarding the Camp were about 20 or in the early 20ties but the Commander . He told the other SS man very proudly how he enjoyed the day before beating and flogging the newcomers . He spoiled his gloves which were torn and bloodstained so he had to get new ones ! He told laughing what great fun it was when the other night SS men took out Jews from sleeping cars and brought them in pyjamas into the Camp . Actually I have not seen any man in the Camp in pyjamas . Maybe they got prisoner wear before I arrived . But a man from Breslau Mr. T. had to go round for the whole time in slippers as the SS men who arrested him did not give him time to put on his shoes . One hour passed . Then we were ordered to alight and to take off our hats and glasses . In order to make you understand what happened now I have to tell you that in German railway stations the travellers going from one platform to the other or leaving the station have to walk through subways below the rails . We were ordered to hurry into such a tunnel and had to run along a row of SS men kicking and beating with the but ends people who in their opinion did not walk quick enough . I remember how they threw away the stick of an man who for some years after a serious illness had to use a walking stick . There were of course men who could not 3 walk quickly men near the 70 sick people and they experienced for the first time the brutality of our guards . Many men tumbled down the steps leading to the subway one pushing the other in order to avoid kicking and whipping by the SS . They used long whips with a small ball made of lead on the end . I was lucky enough to eschew any whipping . Other people told me that though the wounds were bleeding they were not very painful . When we came into the subway the exit was closed by a cordon of guards and we were penned and pressed against the walls of the tunnel by the SS men coming into the subway behind our backs . The guards whipped us and poured cold water into the crowd and threatened us with their guns shouting and ordering us to get closer together though we were pressed to the walls like sardines in a tin . In fear of death many men cried and moaned everybody tried without any consideration what happened to the other people to escape the whipping and the rough treatment . I was sure that we would not leave this subway alive . Old men got breathless some were trampled down . Never in my whole life and I was in the 1st war for nearly 4½ years 2½ years in the frontline with an Infantry Regiment I have seen such a terrible scene . Suddenly we got the order to leave the subway of course again in a hurry and the cordon clowing up the tunnel gave way . I saw one man lying on the pavement trampled down unable to get up or to move himself and he was carried away by 4 other men . I am sure he was dead or dying the first of the many victims of the ‘ action that was the official term used in the Camp . Later on we were told that the very first victim was a man who committed suicide the night before in the train . Not the only one who did it . A former Judge from Breslau committed suicide in the first night in the Camp with a pocket knife he had hidden from the Nazis . When we left the staion running we found many lorries outside waiting . We were helped into it with the heels or butt ends of the guardsmen . In the crowded lorry we had to sit our heads bent down . As soon as a man lifted his head up a little bit he got a whipping and whipping was the usual way of notice when the guard whished to talk with one of us . For instance he asked a man ‘ What is your profession ? Answer ‘ Formerly I was a banker . The SS man laughing ‘ What ? You are a rogue . Well what are you ? Answer ? of course regarding the whip ‘ A rogue ! After a ride of about half an hour we arrived in the notorious Camp of Buchenwald a name of horror for every Jew and all decent people in Germany . Some short general remarks Buchenwald is situated in the middle of Thuringia on top of a hill surrounded by lovely forest covered small mountains . It is really blasphemy if 4 you remember that Goethe recovered rather often near this place from his duties and found fresh inspirations in this beautiful landscape . The place is hort of water due to the structure of the soil . The whole large compound is urrounded by electrified barbed wire . The main entrace is towered by a big platform from where the whole compound can be overlooked . There always two guardsmen are standing with machine guns ready for action . Round the whole Camp small watch turrets are built so near each to the next that the sentries are able to cover the distance between them by rifle shots . They are armed with one machine gun each besides the gun every guardsman is carrying . When our lorries had passed the main gate they stopped on a large parade ground and we had to leave the lorries in the usual hurry and with the usual help . It was about 10 a.m. and during the whole day we were moved on the parade ground . For the whole time Jews from all parts of Germany arrived . The Hews from Berlin were brought to the C.C. at Sachsenhausen near Berlin the Jews from South Germany to Dachau near Munich . At Buchenwald during these 2 days about 10.000 people arrived about 3.000 between them from Breslau and about the same number from Frankfurt on Main . It was a dark night when at midnight we physically and mentally exhausted not to say broken were allowed to enter a large hut . We had not got any food nor drink since the afternoon the day before . We passed the rest of the night in the not yet finished hut sitting on large logs and boards leaning one to the other . Early next morning we had to leave the hut . We were allowed to loiter for a short time in front of the hut before we were ordered again to the parade ground . But not before 11 we got some so called coffee we were standing in rank and file and one small bowl had to do for 10 people . The last man of course could be happy if he got more than a few drops ! Never in my life any coffee tasted so nicely to me though it was no real coffee ! One experience we had this morning a man broke down on the parade ground and was laid down under a tree . He was moaning and apparently suffering very much . Nobody was allowed to talk to him nor to give him any help not even a drop of water . He was lying there till he was dead . Now I shall have to explain to you the arrangements in the huts our accomodation for the next weeks . The prisoners who had to live for a longer time some for many years in the C.C. were accomodated in small huts got prisoner wear had to work hard they could wash every second day . We 10.000 taken into the C.C. during this ‘ November action were accomodated into 5 large wooden sheds quickly and roughly built . The arrangements in these 5 huts I can not compare but with the bookshelves in a library . On the walls and between there were erected large wooden frames with 5 storeys of shelves . On these bare boards we had to lie and to try to sleep . But books stand in the shelves of a library here nobody but the men on the top of the storeys could really sit down as the other ‘ frames were not high enough . The men sleeping in the upper storeys had to climb up like monkeys . I used to take off my jacket and used it as a pillow wrapping myself in my overcoat . I could not take off my shoes for the night as one of my laces was torn and I had to knot it . The nights were terrible . I slept mostly for about 2 hours . Most people had caught a cold so they were coughing and sneezing the whole night . Many had to get up in the night . It was almost impossible to sleep . In the first nights which I shall describe later many men started crying driven nearly or really mad . There were some men about 70 on the other hand boys under 18 crippled men sick men the worst very likely a barrister from Hannover wounded in the last war with many scars in his face one eye lost incapable to walk without other people help . One of the worst features was the thirst . We had no possibility to get water . Later on we could buy sometimes mineral water though rather expensive . When we got this water for the first time nearly fighting was going on because many men were afraid they would not get a bottle . One rainy day we were standing under the caves with mugs to collect some rainwater for a drink . I had caught a very bad cold in consequence of which I was nearly deaf on one ear for about 2 months . I went to the doctor to get a tabloid but it was more important to get the few drops of water he could give with the tabloid . Some doctors between us had started a volontary medical service in the huts an emergency service only of course . Who fell seriously ill was mostly lost . The sick people were brought into a special room and some serious cases into the Camp Hospital . Day after day many of the prisoners died . They were cremated and not before some weeks later the relatives got the ashes . Never before in my life I have seen the connection between body and sould as clearly as there a man got a nervous breakdown and collapsed afterwards and many of them could not recover . It have no estimate about the death rate but I was told by an older prisoner that on a single day up to 30 men died . The sanitary conveniences were much worse than I have ever seen in the last war . It was really a miracle that no epidemic disease broke out . I can not give a description but I have to mention that the whole plant consisted from pits and long poles in the open air and that there was room for about 75 at a time and we were 10.000 . 6 As indigestion was a common feature the men were queuing the whole dau for the use of this convenience . During the night we were not allowed to got there but in groups of 10 men and one of them had to ask leave of one of the guards standing on the nearest turret . For fun they made conditions for instance they ordered the men to lie down at first in a rainy night of course in another night a man had to sing a song before getting the permission . When a man left the hut alone not aware that he had to wait for the others the sentry shot . Washing accomodation did not exist . I could not wash even my hands or rinse my mouth for the whole 3 weeks . Food was not bad but on Sundays we did not get a midday meal . For supper we got bread rather plentiful . But we had no opportunity to keep our supplies in a proper way . We had to kepp it in our shelves where we slept or in the pockets of our coats . For supper we got sometimes sausage or smoked herring or meat jelly but we had to eat it with the fingers as we got in the first week neither plates nor cutlery . And we knew that our comrades who distributed the food hat not washed their hands as long as we . For the midday meal a hot dish about 200 plates or bowls and sppons were available for 2000 men in one hut . Therefore everybody who was not so fortunate to be between the first 200 had to use a dirty plate and spoon as there was no earthly chance to clean it . Later on we could buy of course very expensive plates and sppons and mugs for our own . But there was still no chance for cleaning your things . I used to try to clean my plate with the paper sheets from a copy book I could get . During our meals we had no opportunity to sit down . We had to stand in fron of the hut or to eat walking to and fro outdoors or in the evening lying on the shelves . Before we were released we had to leave our bought plates etc . and to pay each for using the Government property ! In the huts and outside the huts big loudspeakers were installed and all order were given from H.Q. by loudspeaker . When we were addressed the usual language was Jewish swines listen or Jewish gang for release or for other reasons they said always The Jew X. Anything was done to strain on our nerves and to produce a nervous breakdown . And now I shall have to try to describe to you the terrible horroe happening during the first 4 or 5 nights . Between our huts our 5 huts were rather small passages . In the middle of the night a detachment of the guardsmen brought a sort of frame which I have seen in daylight on the second day to lay down men for flogging and then they flogged and whipped 7 several men with 25 strokes of a whip or ‘ Cat I do know why they tortured these men maybe they had committed some ‘ crime perhaps given an answer not having been asked for . But i know that they took indiscreminately especially young men from the huts and especially those who started crying . How many were killed in these nights I can not tell . We were not allowed to leave our shelves . But I heard more than once the order ‘ Take away the corpse and one morning I saw a man dead in front of our hut . To describe what was going on inside the hut during th such a night is impossible . Old and young men in fear of getting flogged cried and moaned some were praying many soiled themselves as they were not allowed to leave the hut . Small wonder that some perhaps driven mad or in a vain attempt to escape ran against the electrified barbed wire and died at once . I have to mention that the older prisoners who had to assist our guards some old Communists who had been for 5 years and longer in the CC tried their best to help us especially during these terrible scenes . They smacked us every now and then but only when one of the supervisors was present . It was not wise to stand in the first or last file as the SS men liked to kick and smack us as often as possible . Flogging I have seen in daytime too one man got 25 strokes because he was walking by mistake round instead of sitting in rank and file on the parade ground . It was obvious that the flogging was great fun for the men doing this job a special commando . After the first 5 days were gone the SS men left us in the whole to ourselves and we were guarded by older prisoners some well educated by the SS men . Other tortures I have not seen with my own eyes . But next to the entrance gate we heard often moaning and crying and we were told by the older prisoners that the moaning men were hanged up with their arms on the ceiling for 24 hours . I was asked often how did you get out ? About one week after our imprisonment the first men were released all men who could prove that the had an opportunity for emigration in the very near future . After a fortnight all men over 60 were released an by the end of the 3rd week all those who could produce the certificate that they were in the possession of the Remembrance Medal for combattants in the last war . Only who had by pure chance this certificate in his pocket ! Other papers who proved that they were combatants of the last war were not accepted . I was lucky enough to have this certificate with me . And now to end my story some items from our release with a somewhat comical tinge . Before our release we got a shave and had of course to pay for it . We were warned by more experienced people to hide some of our money and 8 so I kept in my hand ½ Mk about lod to pay for it but the SS man serving as cashier took out of my pocket 5 Mk about 8/ that was the most expensive shave I ever got . Before we left the Camp the had the impudence to collect money from us for the ‘ Winterhilfswerk des Deutschen Volkes Winter Relief Funds for the German People and I am still glad that I managed to give not more than 10 Pf . 2d to these brutes . I am sure that they kept the money for themselves . Guards brought us to the main road leading to Weimar leading us through shrubs on a small slippery pathway through the forest in a hurry of course . From Weimar we were not allowed to travel by fast train . Next morning I arrived at home but I had to report at once to the Gestapo H.Q. and to sign a form that I acknowledged to have been released from the C.C. only to be able to speedy up my and my family emigration . But it lasted 8 long and dreadful months before we reached this helpful country and could spleep for the first time without fear to experience once more a German concentration camp . That is the story I have to tell you . We are in the middle of the fight against these dark and evil powers or perhaps starting the last chapter . We are told and we read so often that after this war is over anything will be better than it was before . So the story might be true that one soldier told his pal Well if the world will be such a lovely place after the war why did we start this war earlier ? It is up to the younger generation to build up a better world from the shambles our generation left them . And when one day the last Nazi died in a C.C. there should be no room for Concentration Camps any more in a world free from fear .
2	Mr Levy reports on his father experiences from 1933 when he lost his job with the town council of Berlin . Thanks to his mixed marriage he did not get into trouble until he was suddenly arrested and sent to Buchenwald in 1938 . His son tells about the ill treatment there the filth sadistic atrocities mostly due to the young camp leader Jonny and his SS helpers . Preferably high officials of the former regime were ordered to clean the latrines it even happened that people were drowned there . His father was released when his family got a ticket for him to Shanghai in February 1939 where he later died . 9 . References Punishments . Suicides . Bibelfeorscher . Communists . Social democrats . Atrocities . Ill treatment at Buchenwald In 1933 at the start of the Nazi régime my father lost his job working for the Berlin city council . He was a qualified banker and was employed by the council in this capacity . Apart from the loss of his post my father encountered relatively few problems right up until 1938 . This was mainly because he was married to an Aryan and the children from this marriage had been baptised and brought up in the Christian faith . But in 1938 he was suddenly arrested despite not having committed any criminal offence . Ten days later we learned that he had been imprisoned in Buchenwald . I have no cause to doubt my father testimony which he revealed to us under pledge of secrecy . In Buchenwald he had to sign a declaration stating that he would tell nobody of his experiences not even his closest family members . On arrival his head was shaved . Then he was made to hand over his personal effects . These were stuffed into a sack and 2 drenched in a chemical fluid which meant the resulting creases could never be removed . My father was given the hardest labour in the camp . He was assigned to work in the quarry . Shifts of 10 12 hours were not uncommon . The vast rocks had to be moved at a running pace . Any prisoner caught slacking because he was simply too exhausted was reported . This almost certainly led to him being put over the block . These punishments were inflicted by a young SS man known as Jonny . His brutality was feared throughout the camp . The punishments were inflicted as follows when the prisoners returned to the block after work tired and near to collapse a roll call would suddenly be announced . What scant food the men were given had to be left behind as they scrambled to get to the parade ground as quickly as they could . Once there they were made to stand to attention for up to 18 hours until the camp leader Jonny appeared . The prisoner who was to be punished had to step forward as his name was called and go and fetch the whipping block on which he was about to be beaten . Three burly SS men would then strap the victim to the block . Jonny never let anyone get away with fewer than 25 lashes . While two of the SS men beat the victim on the bare backside with sticks a third would keep count . It often happened that after 20 lashes this guy would suddenly announce I lost count ! and the whole procedure would have to be started again . By the time the prisoner was unstrapped from the block he was completely broken even unconscious . Very often the man kidneys had been struck so hard that the victim never ever recovered from the damage . This appalling roll call happened three times every week . The food in short supply and of very poor quality was dished out in the same bowls the prisoners washed in . Even those inmates with open tuberculosis were using the same bowls for eating and washing . Inside Buchenwald camp was an area known as the death zone a 3 strip of land about 20 metres wide that ran all the way round the electrified perimeter fence . Any prisoner entering the death zone was shot dead either by one of the watch tower guards or an SS man who happened to be nearby – there was no warning . Stepping onto this strip of land was treated as an escape attempt . One of the guards on duty grabbed my father hat and tossed it into the death zone . If my father had gone after it he would have been immediately shot while trying to escape . Many desperate prisoners chose to commit suicide by running onto the high voltage fence . In the morning you could see their charred corpses hanging from the wire . One of the most repulsive and degrading jobs was that undertaken by the 4711 column . The people chosen for this work were mainly those who had held high office or been important figures in the political and cultural life of the Weimar Republic . It was the job of this column to clean the latrines . Without any equipment . Anyone caught being physically sick would be thrown into the latrine by the SS guard on duty . Many drowned in the excrement . One of the blocks housed Jehovah Witnesses and prominent Communists and Social Democrats . Unfortunately my father did not know any of their names . For a joke the SS used to put these people on a chain and make them bark like dogs . One of the cruellest punishments was what was known as the iron maiden a torture implement modelled on that used in the Middle Ages . It consisted of an iron cage lined with long sharp nails . Prisoners subjected to this punishment rarely survived the ordeal . We were only able to secure my father release because we his family managed to obtain a passage for him to Shanghai . He was therefore freed earlier than others but on the condition that he reported every day to his local police station . My father left Germany on 20 February 1939 . He died in Shanghai as a result of the ill treatment suffered while in prison .
